Parameters:
signalNumber:
The number of the Unix signal to send to the process.
>*Note:* The <signalNumber> parameter is ignored on Windows systems.

signalName:
The name of a Unix signal, minus the leading "SIG". (For example, to
send SIGHUP to a process, use HUP as the <signalName>.)
>*Note:* The <signalName> parameter is ignored on Windows systems.

processName:
The name and parameters, if any, for the running sub-process.

Description:
Use the <kill> command to send a signal to a <process> telling it
to terminate processing with extreme prejudice.

On Unix based systems Mac and Linux systems, the <kill> command sends the
specified signal to a <process>. If no signal is specified, the <kill> command
sends SIGTERM. Check the systems 'kill' command documentation for information
about available signals.

If possible, use the <close process> command instead of the <kill>
<command> to terminate a <process>. The <kill> <command> causes an
immediate <exit>, and may prevent the <process> from removing temporary
<files> or doing other cleanup tasks.
