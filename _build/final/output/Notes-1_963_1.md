<h1 class="title">LiveCode 1.963.1 Release Notes</h1>

[TOC]

# Overview

LiveCode 9.0 enables access to libraries and platform APIs written in
many other languages thanks to the community-funded 'Infinite
LiveCode' project.

This includes a greatly improved Extension Builder virtual machine.

LiveCode 9.0 contains many additional improvements to support LiveCode
app developers, including:

-   A new "spinner" widget

-   OAuth2 authentication library for use with web APIs (e.g. Facebook,
    Google and GitHub)

-   A command argument parser library for building command-line
    standalones

-   Updates and performance improvements for existing widgets

# Known issues

-   The installer will currently fail if you run it from a network share
    on Windows. Please copy the installer to a local disk before
    launching on this platform.

-   The browser widget does not work on 32-bit Linux.

-   64-bit standalones for Mac OS X do not have support for audio
    recording.

# Breaking changes

## Boolean constants

In this release, boolean constants `true` and `false` have been changed so that
they resolve to values of boolean type (rather than string). This will affect
any uses of the `is strictly` operator on such values, i.e. previously the following
were true:

  true is strictly a string
  false is strictly a string

Now, they are both false, and the following are true:

  true is strictly a boolean
  false is strictly a boolean

Boolean constants passed as elements of arrays to LCB handlers will not require
conversion to boolean values in LCB - in fact any attempt to do so assuming they
are strings will cause an error. Any array elements which are intended to be
booleans in LCB should be checked for their type before conversion. For example,
any of the following could be done by an LCB library user:

    put true into tArray["enabled"]
    put "true" into tArray["enabled"]
    put (tVar is not "enabled") into tArray["enabled"]

An LCB handler to which `tArray` is passed should do the following:

    variable tEnabled as Boolean
    if tArray["enabled"] is a boolean then
        put tAction["enabled"] into tEnabled
    else
        put tAction["enabled"] parsed as boolean into tEnabled
    end if

## Infinity constant

The constant `infinity` has been added to the language in this release. As a
result, the unquoted literal `infinity` is now reserved. Any existing uses
of it should be quoted, as otherwise it will resolve to the floating point
value representing infinity, rather than the string "infinity".

## Implicit object

A number of LCB commands use an implicit object to provide context for their
execution. Some of these commands also allow specifying an explicit object.
These commands are:

-   `execute script`
-   `send`
-   `post`
-   `image from file`
-   `resolve file` - new in this version

In previous releases `execute script` and `image from file` would use
`this card of the defaultStack` as the implicit object even if called from
a widget. The `send` and `post` commands, however, used
`this card of the defaultStack` when in a library module handler and the host
widget when in a widget module handler. This release changes `execute script`
and `image from file` to also use the host widget as the implicit object. This
means, for example, that `image from file` will resolve a relative file path
relative to the `stackFile` the host widget is on rather than the `stackFile` of
the `defaultStack`.

# Platform support

The engine supports a variety of operating systems and versions. This section describes the platforms that we ensure the engine runs on without issue (although in some cases with reduced functionality).

## Windows

LiveCode supports the following versions of Windows:

-   Windows 7 (both 32-bit and 64-bit)
-   Windows Server 2008
-   Windows 8.x (Desktop)
-   Windows 10

**Note:** On 64-bit Windows installations, LiveCode can run either as a 32-bit application through the WoW layer or as a native 64-bit Windows application, depending on the installer that is chosen.

## Linux

LiveCode supports the following Linux distributions, on 32-bit or
64-bit Intel/AMD or compatible processors:

-   Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04
-   Fedora 23 & 24
-   Debian 7 (Wheezy) and 8 (Jessie) [server]
-   CentOS 7 [server]

LiveCode may also run on Linux installations which meet the following
requirements:

-   Required dependencies for core functionality:

    -   glibc 2.13 or later
    -   glib 2.0 or later

-   Optional requirements for GUI functionality:
    -   GTK/GDK 2.24 or later
    -   Pango with Xft support
    -   esd (optional, needed for audio output)
    -   mplayer (optional, needed for media player functionality)
    -   lcms (optional, required for color profile support in images)
    -   gksu (optional, required for privilege elevation support)

**Note:** If the optional requirements are not present then LiveCode will still run but the specified features will be disabled.

**Note:** The requirements for GUI functionality are also required by Firefox and Chrome, so if your Linux distribution runs one of those, it will run LiveCode.

**Note:** It may be possible to compile and run LiveCode Community for Linux on other architectures but this is not officially supported.

## Mac

The Mac engine supports:

-   10.9.x (Mavericks)
-   10.10.x (Yosemite)
-   10.11.x (El Capitan)
-   10.12.x (Sierra)
-   10.13.x (High Sierra)
-   10.14.x (Mojave)
-   10.15.x (Catalina)
-   11.x (Big Sur)

## iOS

iOS deployment is possible when running LiveCode IDE on a Mac, and provided Xcode is installed and has been set in LiveCode _Preferences_ (in the _Mobile Support_ pane).

Currently, the supported versions of Xcode are:

-   Xcode 9.2 on MacOS 10.12 (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.12.6)
-   Xcode 10.1 on MacOS 10.13 (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.13.4)
-   Xcode 11.3 on MacOS 10.14 (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.14.4)
-   Xcode 12.4 on MacOS 10.15 and above (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.15.4)
-   Xcode 12.5 on MacOS 11.0 and above

It is also possible to set other versions of Xcode, to allow testing
on a wider range of iOS simulators. For instance, on MacOS 10.13
(High Sierra), you can add _Xcode 9.2_ in the _Mobile Support_ preferences,
to let you test your stack on the _iOS Simulator 11.2_.

We currently support building against the following versions of the iOS SDK:

-   11.2 (included in Xcode 9.2)
-   12.1 (included in Xcode 10.1)
-   13.2 (included in Xcode 11.3)
-   14.4 (included in Xcode 12.4)
-   14.5 (included in Xcode 12.5)

## Android

LiveCode allows you to save your stack as an Android application, and
also to deploy it on an Android device or simulator from the IDE.

Android deployment is possible from Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

The Android engine supports devices using x86, x86-64, ARM and ARM64 processors.
It will run on the following versions of Android:

-   5.0-5.1 (Lollipop)
-   6.0 (Marshmallow)
-   7.x (Nougat)
-   8.x (Oreo)
-   9.0 (Pie)
-   10.0 (Q)

To enable deployment to Android devices, you need to download the
[Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other), and
then use the 'Android SDK Manager' to install:

-   the latest "Android SDK Tools"
-   the latest "Android SDK Platform Tools"

You also need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK).  On Linux,
this usually packaged as "openjdk".  LiveCode requires JDK version 1.6
or later.

Once you have set the path of your Android SDK in the "Mobile Support"
section of the LiveCode IDE's preferences, you can deploy your stack
to Android devices.

Some users have reported successful Android Watch deployment, but it
is not officially supported.

## HTML5

LiveCode applications can be deployed to run in a web browser, by running the LiveCode engine in JavaScript and using modern HTML5 JavaScript APIs.

HTML5 deployment does not require any additional development tools to be installed.

LiveCode HTML5 standalone applications are currently supported for running in recent versions of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://support.apple.com/HT204416).  For more information, please see the "HTML5 Deployment" guide in the LiveCode IDE.

# Setup

## Installation

Each version of LiveCode installs can be installed to its own,
separate folder.  This allow multiple versions of LiveCode to be
installed side-by-side.  On Windows (and Linux), each version of
LiveCode has its own Start Menu (or application menu) entry. On Mac OS
X, each version has its own app bundle.

On Mac OS X, install LiveCode by mounting the `.dmg` file and dragging
the app bundle to the `Applications` folder (or any other suitable
location).

For Windows and Linux, the default installation locations when
installing for "All Users" are:

| Platform | Path                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows  | `<x86 program files folder>/RunRev/LiveCode <version>` |
| Linux    | `/opt/livecode/livecode-<version>`                     |

The installations when installing for "This User" are:

| Platform | Path                                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `<user roaming app data folder>/RunRev/Components/LiveCode <version>` |
| Linux    | `~/.runrev/components/livecode-<version>`                             |

**Note:** If installing for "All Users" on Linux, either the **gksu** tool must be available, or you must manually run the LiveCode installer executable as root (e.g. using **sudo** or **su**).

## Uninstallation

On Windows, the installer hooks into the standard Windows uninstall mechanism. This is accessible from the "Add or Remove Programs" applet in the windows Control Panel.

On Mac OS X, drag the app bundle to the Trash.

On Linux, LiveCode can be removed using the `setup.x86` or `setup.x86_64` program located in LiveCode's installation directory.

## Reporting installer issues

If you find that the installer fails to work for you then please report it using the [LiveCode Quality Control Centre](http://quality.livecode.com) or by emailing support@livecode.com.

Please include the following information in your report:

-   Your platform and operating system version
-   The location of your home or user folder
-   The type of user account you are using (guest, restricted, admin etc.)
-   The installer log file.

The installer log file can be located as follows:

| Platform        | Path                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 2000/XP | `<documents and settings folder>/<user>/Local Settings/` |
| Windows Vista/7 | `<users folder>/<user>/AppData/Local/RunRev/Logs`        |
| Linux           | `<home>/.runrev/logs`                                    |

## Activating LiveCode Indy or Business edition

The licensing system ties your product licenses to a customer account system, meaning that you no longer have to worry about finding a license key after installing a new copy of LiveCode. Instead, you simply have to enter your email address and password that has been registered with our customer account system and your license key will be retrieved automatically.

Alternatively it is possible to activate the product via the use of a specially encrypted license file. These will be available for download from the customer center after logging into your account. This method will allow the product to be installed on machines that do not have access to the internet.

## Command-line installation

It is possible to invoke the installer from the command-line on Linux and Windows. When doing command-line installation, no GUI will be displayed.  The installation process is controlled by arguments passed to the installer.

Run the installer using a command in the form:

    <installer> install -ui [OPTION ...]

where `<installer>` should be replaced with the path of the installer executable or app (inside the DMG) that has been downloaded.  The result of the installation operation will be written to the console.

The installer understands any of the following `OPTION`s:

| Option               | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-allusers`          | Install the IDE for "All Users". If not specified, LiveCode will be installed for the current user only.                      |
| `-desktopshortcut`   | Place a shortcut on the Desktop (Windows-only)                                                                                |
| `-startmenu`         | Place shortcuts in the Start Menu (Windows-only)                                                                              |
| `-location LOCATION` | The folder to install into. If not specified, the `LOCATION` defaults to those described in the "Installation" section above. |
| `-log LOGFILE`       | The file to which to log installation actions. If not specified, no log is generated.                                         |

**Note:** the command-line installer does not do any authentication. When installing for "All Users", you will need to run the installer command as an administrator.

As the installer is actually a GUI application, it needs to be run slightly differently from other command-line programs.

On Windows, the command is:

    start /wait <installer> install -ui [OPTION ...]

## Command-line uninstallation

It is possible to uninstall LiveCode from the command-line on Windows and Linux.  When doing command-line uninstallation, no GUI will be displayed.

Run the uninstaller using a command of the form:

    <uninstaller> uninstall -ui

Where <exe> is _.setup.exe_ on Windows, and _.setup.x86_ on Linux. This executable, for both of the platforms, is located in the folder where LiveCode is installed.

The result of the uninstallation operation will be written to the console.

**Note:** the command-line uninstaller does not do any authentication.  When removing a version of LiveCode installed for "All Users", you will need to run the uninstaller command as an administrator.

## Command-line activation for LiveCode Indy or Business edition

It is possible to activate an installation of LiveCode for all users by using the command-line.  When performing command-line activation, no GUI is displayed.  Activation is controlled by passing command-line arguments to LiveCode.

Activate LiveCode using a command of the form:

    <livecode> activate -file LICENSEFILE -passphrase SECRET

where `<livecode>` should be replaced with the path to the LiveCode executable or app that has been previously installed.

This loads license information from the manual activation file `LICENSEFILE`, decrypts it using the given `SECRET` passphrase, and installs a license file for all users of the computer.  Manual activation files can be downloaded from the [My Products](https://livecode.com/account/products/livecode) page in the LiveCode account management site.

It is also possible to deactivate LiveCode with:

    <livecode> deactivate

Since LiveCode is actually a GUI application, it needs to be run slightly differently from other command-line programs.

On Windows, the command is:

    start /wait <livecode> activate -file LICENSE -passphrase SECRET
    start /wait <livecode> deactivate

On Mac OS X, you need to do:

    <livecode>/Contents/MacOS/LiveCode activate -file LICENSE -passphrase SECRET
    <livecode>/Contents/MacOS/LiveCode deactivate

# LiveCode Community engine changes

## Widget element chunk

In order to facilitate more efficient manipulation of a widget's underlying data, the following xTalk script syntax has been added:

    the <property> of { element <index> , of } <widget>

This syntax maps to the following Extension Builder handlers:

-   `Set<Property>OfElement(<path>, <value>)`
-   `Get<Property>OfElement(<path>)`

For example, once the above handlers have been added to the Tree View widget, we could use `the arrayData of element "a" of element "b" of widget "Tree View"` in order to access the data `tArray["b"]["a"]`, where tArray is the Tree View's underlying array.

This allows modification of a particular node of the Tree View without causing a costly complete recalculation.

The `<index>` in the element chunk expression may also be an indexed array which keeps the same sense as indexing, i.e. if `tArray[1]` is `"x"` and `tArray[2]` is `"y"`, then

`element y of element x of widget 1 === element tArray of widget 1`

Currently this syntax is limited to property-based expressions only - use of the element chunk in any other context will result in an error.

## Re-written LCB VM

The "virtual machine" used to run Extension Builder code has been re-written
from scratch. This new VM provides a framework enabling better extensibility,
better error reporting and, in future, more comprehensive optimizations.

Most existing LCB code should run without any changes. There may be some code
that worked on the previous VM but doesn't in the new VM due to more
comprehensive run-time checking; this is usually fixable with only very minor
changes to the source code.

## Extension Builder Tools

### lc-compile-ffi-java

-   **lc-compile-ffi-java** is a tool to create Extension Builder code which
    provides an interface between LCB modules and the Java Native
    Interface (JNI). It does this by taking a specification of a java
    package written in a domain-specific language and creating an LCB
    module which wraps the necessary foreign handlers which call the
    appropriate JNI methods. See the [documentation for the tool](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/blob/develop/toolchain/lc-compile-ffi-java.1.md)
    and the [description of the DSL](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/tree/develop/docs/specs/java-ffi-dsl.md)
    for more details

## Support for loading multi-module bytecode files (experimental)

The **load extension** command is now able to load Extension Builder
bytecode files (`.lcm` files) that contain multiple modules' bytecode.

The first module in each `.lcm` file is treated as the "main module"
of the module (i.e. the library or widget), and other modules are
treated as support modules.

Support modules only remain loaded if they are used by the main
module, and support modules must be submodules of the main module.
For example, if the main module is "com.livecode.newbutton", then all
other modules in the bytecode file must have names like
"com.livecode.newbutton.&lt;something>".

# LiveCode builder changes

## Extension Builder Standard Library

### System error information

-   Two new expressions have been added for accessing platform-specific
    system error status:

    -   `the system error code` evaluates to the current numerical system
        error code

    -   `the system error message` evaluates to a string describing the
        current system error

-   The new `reset system error` statement clears the current system
    error.

### Mathematical functions

-   Several mathematical functions now throw "domain errors" when
    applied to values that the function is not defined for, including
    `log10()`, `ln()`, `asin()` and `acos()`, and `x ^ y`.

### Sequence operations

-   New syntax has been added for searching partial contents of sequence types (`List`, `String` and `Data`) based on the `offset` operation.
    -   `the offset of <Needle> before <Position> in <Haystack>`
    -   `the offset of <Needle> after <Position> in <Haystack>`
    -   Equivalent syntax has been added for the `index` operation.


-   New syntax has been added for reversing the contents of sequence
    types (`List`, `String` and `Data`).  The `reverse <Value>`
    statement reverses the order of the sequence.

### Foreign function interface

-   The Java integer primtive type JChar has been added.
    This maps to uint16_t.

-   When passing a Number to one of the foreign integer types (`LCInt`, `LCUInt`,
    `IntSize`, `UIntSize`), an error will be thrown if the value is outside the
    range of the requested type.

-   The `IntSize` and `UIntSize` types can hold the full 64-bit integer range,
    however the maximum magnitude which is supported for converting to and from
    Number is 2^53. An error will be thrown for any conversions outside this
    range.


-   The following deprecated foreign type names have been removed from
    the `com.livecode.foreign` module:
    -   `pointer` (replaced by `Pointer`)
    -   `bool` (replaced by `CBool`)
    -   `uint` (replaced by `UInt32` or `CUInt`)
    -   `int` (replaced by `Int32` or `CInt`)
    -   `float` (replaced by `Float32` or `CFloat`)
    -   `double` (replaced by `Float64` or `CDouble`)
    -   `NativeCString` (replaced by `ZStringNative`)

### List operations

-   The `&` operator can now be used to concatenate two `List`s.  For
    example, `[1, 2] & [3, 4]` evaluates to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Assertions

-   Checks for handler preconditions can now be included using the new
    `expect` statement.  For example, the following statement will throw
    an error if the value `pProbability` is out of the valid range for
    probabilities:

        expect that (pProbability >= 0 and pProbability <= 1) \
           because "Probabilities must be in the range [0,1]"

    The `that` keyword and the `because <Reason>` clauses are optional.

### Java utilities

There is now a utility library for manipulating java objects. It contains
a type `JObject` which wraps a Java object, some type conversion operations:

-   `StringFromJString` - converts a Java string to an LCB String
-   `StringToJString` - converts an LCB String to a Java string
-   `DataFromJByteArray` - converts a Java byte array to LCB Data
-   `DataToJByteArray` - converts LCB Data to a Java byte array

and a utility for determining the class of a given java object:

-   `GetJavaClassName` - return an LCB String containing the class name of the given `JObject`

Syntax for converting between a JObject and Pointer have been added to the
Java utility library.

-   `PointerToJObject` - converts a Pointer to a JObject
-   `PointerFromJObject` - converts a JObject to a Pointer

These can be used in APIs where `Pointer` is the type of a platform-agnostic
parameter whose underlying type is assumed to be `jobject` when used in a
platform-specific implementation, for example:

    -- pView is assumed to be a JObject with underlying type android.view.View
    set my native layer to PointerFromJObject(pView)

### Date and time

-   `the local date` now returns a list with an additional 7th element.  This is the local time zone's offset from UTC, in seconds.

-   The new `the universal date` expression provides the date in the UTC+00:00 timezone.  It returns a list in the same format as `the local date`.

### Mathematical Operator Precedence

-   The exponentiation operator `^` now has higher precedence than
    unary minus, meaning for example that -1^2 evaluates to -1 rather
    than 1, as it does in xTalk Script.

## Extension Builder Host Library

### Widget library

New syntax has been added to obtain a reference to the widget, and to use that
reference when notifying the engine of property changes via the `trigger all`
command.

This is most useful when LCB handlers within a widget module are used as
asynchronous callback functions passed to foreign functions, as these may be
called at a time when the widget is not the currently active widget. Using the
reference prevents updates being seen as coming from the wrong widget.

The `popup widget` command now correctly positions the widget.

A new expression `my pixel scale` has been implemented. Use the widget's
pixel scale to calculate the size of an image to draw. For example,
when drawing an image to `my bounds` create an image sized using
`my width * my pixel scale, my height * my pixel scale` otherwise the image will be
stretched to match the pixel scale. The pixel scale is a per-window/screen property
so may change if the user moves a window to a new screen.
New syntax has been added to enable property triggers to be
fired directly from within a widget: trigger all.

At the moment the only property trigger that exists is the
‘property listening’ mechanism available in the IDE. You should
use ‘trigger all’ after a widget property has changed internally
(for example because something in a native layer has changed) so
that the IDE can be notified that the property has changed.

In the future single property variants and other types of trigger
may be introduced.

### Canvas library

A new statement `begin effect only layer with <effect>` has been implemented to
allow drawing shadow & glow effects without rendering the source content

For example to draw a dropshadow of a rectangle without drawing the rectangle itself:
	variable tEffect as Effect
	put outer shadow effect into tEffect

    begin effect only layer with tEffect on this canvas
    fill rectangle path of rectangle [50,50,100,100] on this canvas
    end layer on this canvas

New syntax has been added to enable getting image metadata and density
information.

The image 'metadata' property returns data associated with the image in the
form of an array.

The image 'density' property returns an images density in dots per inch (DPI).
This allows widgets to scale images appropriately for display.

A new statement `clip to <path> on <canvas>` has been implemented to allow drawing on a
canvas to be clipped to the path. Previously the clip region could only be set to a
rectangle via the `clip to <rectangle> on <canvas>` statement.

For example to draw an image into a circle:

    clip to circle path centered at point [my width /2,my height / 2] with radius my width/2 on this canvas
    variable tImage as Image
    put image from resource file "foo.png" into tImage
    draw tImage into rectangle [0, 0, the width of tImage, the height of tImage] of this canvas

### Engine Library

-   The `execute script` command has been improved and now allows
    specification of a target object and list of arguments. For example:

      variable tScriptObject as ScriptObject
      resolve script object "this card" into tScriptObject
      execute script "return param(1) + param(2)" in tScriptObject with [1, 2]


-   Widgets and library modules can now get the path to
    their resources folder using `my resources folder`.
    If there is no resources folder attached to the calling
    module, then nothing is returned.


-   Library handlers can now access the delimiter properties set in the
    most recent script context using `the line delimiter`, `the item delimiter`,
    `the row delimiter` and `the column delimiter`.


-   You can now use `the <modifierkey> is [currently] down` expression to
    determine if the shift, command, control, alt/option or caps lock keys
    are down. Use the optional `currently` adverb to differentiate between
    the shift key being down at the present moment and it being down when the
    current event occurred.

        if the shift key is down then
           DoShiftKeyThing()
        end if

-   You can now use `resolve file <path expression> [relative to <script object expression>]`
    statement to resolve a relative file path to an absolute file path in the same
    way that it would be resolved in xTalk Script.

## Extension Builder Tools

### lc-compile

#### Command-line interface

-   A new `--verbose` command line flag has been added.  If it is specified, **lc-compile** will output additional debugging information.

-   The new `--forcebuiltins` command line flag can be used in combination with
    the `--outputauxc OUTFILE` option to generate shims for C foreign bindings.
    Use the output file to link with any static libraries used by modules on iOS
    to create a lcext binary and the shims will ensure that required objects from
    the static libraries are included in the resulting binary.

#### Errors

-   Parsing of numeric literals, in general, has been tightened up. In
    particular, the compiler will detect invalid suffixes on numeric
    literals meaning you cannot accidentally elide a number with an
    identifier.

        1.344foo -- ERROR
        0xabcdefgh -- ERROR
        0b010432 -- ERROR


-   List expressions with more than 254 elements will now generate an error.
-   Array expressions with more than 127 key-value pairs will now generate an error.
-   Array constants with non-string keys will now generate an error.

-   A new error has been added for identifiers in declaration context that
    contain `.` - identifiers should always be declared without
    qualification.

#### Warnings

-   A new warning has been added for identifiers that may conflict with
    syntax keywords.


-   `metadata` definitions that occur before module imports no longer
    trigger a warning.

#### Manifest

-   A module now outputs its type to the manifest XML.

#### Messages

-   Errors, warnings and informational messages now display the affected
    line of code and visually indicate the position where the problem
    was found.  For example, the output might look like:

        foo.lcb:2:26: error: Identifier 'InvalidExpression' not declared
          constant kBadConstant is InvalidExpression
                                   ^

### lc-run

-   **lc-run** now has the _experimental_ ability to load and run
    bytecode assemblies containing multiple LCB modules.  To construct a
    multi-module bytecode assembly, simply concatenate several `.lcm`
    module files together.  The first module found in a bytecode assembly
    is treated as its main module.

## Extension Builder Language

### Foreign Function Interface

-   Obj-C exceptions thrown from calls to obj-c foreign handlers will now be caught
    and rethrown as an LCB error.

-   It is now possible to specify the thread to be used in Obj-C foreign handlers. This is done by appending `?<thread>` to the end of the binding string. Currently the only supported value is `ui`, for running the handler on the iOS main thread, as opposed to the engine thread.

-   It is now possible to specify the thread to be used in Java-bound foreign handlers. This is done by appending `?<thread>` to the end of the binding string. Currently the only supported value is `ui`, for running java on the android UI thread. This has no effect on desktop platforms.

### Android Listener support

An binding string variant has been added which allows the user to
create an interface proxy - that is an instance of a generic
Proxy class for a given interface.

This effectively allows LCB handlers to be registered as the targets
for java interface callbacks, such as event listeners.

The syntax is as follows:

    foreign handler _JNI_CreateListener(in pMapping) returns JObject binds to "java:listener.class.path>interface()"

The foreign handler binding to such a function takes a value that should
either be a `Handler` or an `Array` - if it is a `Handler`, the specified
listener should only have one available callback. If the listener has
multiple callbacks, an array can be used to assign handlers to each. Each
key in the array must match the name of a callback in the listener.
Overloaded methods in the interface are not currently supported.

For example:

    handler type ClickCallback(in pView as JObject)

    foreign handler _JNI_OnClickListener(in pHandler as ClickCallback) returns JObject binds to "java:android.view.View$OnClickListener>interface()"

    foreign handler _JNI_SetOnClickListener(in pButton as JObject, in pListener as JObject) returns nothing binds to "java:android.view.View>setOnClickListener(Landroid/view/View$OnClickListener;)V"

    public handler ButtonClicked(in pView as JObject)
    	-- do something on button click
    end handler

    public handler SetOnClickListenerCallback(in pButton as JObject)
    	unsafe
    		variable tListener as JObject
    		put _JNI_OnClickListener(ButtonClicked) into tListener
    		_JNI_SetOnClickListener(pButton, tListener)
    	end unsafe
    end handler

or

    handler type MouseEventCallback(in pMouseEvent as JObject)

    foreign handler _JNI_MouseListener(in pCallbacks as Array) returns JObject binds to "java:java.awt.event.MouseListener>interface()"

    foreign handler _JNI_SetMouseListener(in pJButton as JObject, in pListener as JObject) returns nothing binds to "java:java.awt.Component>addMouseListener(Ljava/awt/event/MouseListener;)V"

    public handler MouseEntered(in pEvent as JObject)
    	-- do something on mouse entter
    end handler

    public handler MouseExited(in pEvent as JObject)
    	-- do something on mouse entter
    end handler

    public handler SetMouseListenerCallbacks(in pJButton as JObject)
    	variable tArray as Array
    	put MouseEntered into tArray["mouseEntered"]
    	put MouseExited into tArray["mouseExited"]
    	unsafe
    		variable tListener as JObject
    		put _JNI_MouseListener(tArray) into tListener
    		_JNI_SetMouseListener(pJButton, tListener)
    	end unsafe
    end handler

The interface callback return value should now match that
of the invoked handler, i.e. if it returns void, the LCB
handler should return nothing, otherwise it should return
JObject.

### Property definitions

-   It is now possible to define a property named with a string instead of an
    identifier.  This allows properties to have names that are also used as
    syntax keywords.

### Literals

-   Base 2 (binary) integer literals can now be specified by using a
    "0b" prefix, e.g.

        0b0000
        0b1010

-   Base 16 (hexadecimal) integer literals can now be specified by using
    a "0x" prefix.  e.g.

        0xdeadbeef
        0x0123fedc

### Objective-C block support

The handler `CreateObjcBlockPointerFromHandler` has been added the `objc` module
which facilitates the calling of Objective-C methods that require blocks.
Objective-C blocks are objects defining fragments of code which can be called at
a later date, typically used by methods that require progress callbacks or
completion handlers.

`CreateObjcBlockPointerFromHandler` wraps a LCB handler in an `ObjcBlockPointer`
and returns true on success and false otherwise. In order to call the
`CreateObjcBlockPointerFromHandler`, pass the handler to be wrapped as the first
argument and the variable into which the `ObjcBlockPointer` should be placed as
the second.

    private variable sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler as optional ObjcBlockPointer
    private variable sTarget as ScriptObject

    public handler AudioLibraryInitialize() returns Boolean
    	if not CreateObjcBlockPointerFromHandler(RequestPermissionsCompletionHandler, \
    												sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler) then
    		put nothing into sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler
    		return false
    	end if
    	put the caller into sTarget
    	return true
    end handler

    public handler RequestPermissionsCompletionHandler(in pBlock as ObjcBlockPointer, in pGranted as CBool)
    	post "AudioLibraryRequestPermissionsCallback" to sTarget with [pGranted]
    end handler

In the example above, the handler `RequestPermissionsCompletionHandler` is
wrapped by the `ObjcBlockPointer` `sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler`.

The first parameter of the wrapped handler should be an `ObjcBlockPointer`. The
remaining parameters should match those of the Objective-C block the
`ObjcBlockPointer` will be used with.

Once created, an `ObjcBlockPointer` can be used to call Objective-C methods that
require blocks, passing the created `ObjcBlockPointer` where an Objective-C
block would be expected.

    private foreign handler ObjC_AVCaptureDeviceRequestAccessForMediaType(in pMediaType as ObjcId, in pCompletionHandler as ObjcBlockPointer) \
    	returns nothing \
    	binds to "objc:AVCaptureDevice.+requestAccessForMediaType:completionHandler:"

    public handler AudioLibraryRequestPermissions()
    	unsafe
    		ObjC_AVCaptureDeviceRequestAccessForMediaType(StringToNSString("soun"), sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler)
    	end unsafe
    end handler

In the example above, the handler `AudioLibraryRequestPermissions` uses the
previously created block pointer, `sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler`, when
calling the `requestAccessForMediaType:completionHandler:` method of the
`AVCaptureDevice` type. The method expects the second argument,
`completionHandler:`, to be a block that takes a single `BOOL` parameter, which
in this case matched the signature of the handler
`RequestPermissionsCompletionHandler`.

The wrapped handler will be called whenever the block is invoked, with the first
parameter being the `ObjcBlockPointer` used to wrap the handler.

In the above example, the `RequestPermissionsCompletionHandler` handler will be
called when the `completionHandler:` block is invoked, which in this case will
be when the request permissions process has completed.

The lifetime of a created `ObjcBlockPointer` is not automatically managed. When
such a value has no more references to it and it is no longer going to be used,
`DeleteObjcBlockPointer` should be used to free the resources used by it.

    public handler AudioLibraryFinalize()
    	if sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler is not nothing then
    		DeleteObjcBlockPointer(sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler)
    		put nothing into sRequestPermissionsCompletionHandler
    	end if
    end handler

### Variables

-   Handler local variables are now have lexical scope. This means
    variables are accessible from the point of definition to the end of
    the block they are defined in.  Note that:

    -   each `repeat` control structure is considered a single block.

    -   each separate block in an `if`/`else if`/`else` control structure
        is considered a single block.

-   Variables are now reset (either to their default value, or
    unassigned) at the point of the variable definition. In particular,
    any variables defined within a `repeat` block are reset on each
    iteration:

        repeat 5 times
           variable tVar as optional String
           -- tVar is reset to "nothing" every time the loop runs
        end repeat

-   Variables in an inner block can now shadow those in an outer
    block. For example, the following is valid:

        variable tX as Array
        repeat 5 times
           variable tX as Number
           repeat 4 times
              variable tX as String
           end repeat
        end repeat


-   Out parameters are now initialized by default to a suitable empty value at the
    start of the handler. For example:

        public handler GetMyValue(out rValue as Integer)
        end handler

    will result in `rValue` being set to 0.

### Library post and send syntax

Syntax for post and send with no target has been moved from the
widget module to the engine module, so that it can be used by
library modules. In this case the message is dispatched to the
current card of the default stack, as a 'global notification'
would be

### `the caller` syntax

`the caller` syntax has been added to the engine module. It
returns the script object which called a the handler at the
beginning of the current chain of Extension Builder handler
execution.

### Variadic foreign C functions

-   It is now possible to bind to variadic C functions:
    foreign handler printf(in pFormat as Pointer, ...) returns CInt binds to "<builtin>"
    In this case, the '...' must be the last parameter, and there must be at
    least one fixed parameter.

### Objective-C delegate support

Handlers `CreateObjcDelegate` and `CreateObjcDelegateWithContext` have
been added to the objc module which allow the creation of custom
delegate objects with LCB implementations of protocol methods.

In order to create a delegate to handle a particular protocol method,
pass in the protocol name as the first argument and the mapping from
method names to LCB handlers as the second argument. For example, to
create a selectionChanged message for an `NSTextView`, we need to create
a handler

    private handler DidChangeSelection(in pNotification as ObjcObject) returns nothing
    	post "selectionChanged"
    end handler

and create a `NSTextViewDelegate`:

    variable tDelegate as optional ObjcObject
    put CreateObjcDelegate( \
    	"NSTextViewDelegate", \
    	{"textViewDidChangeSelection:": DidChangeSelection}, \
    	) into tDelegate
    if tDelegate is not nothing then
    	put tDelegate into mTextViewDelegate
    end if

Optionally, a context parameter can be passed in at delegate creation
time:

    put CreateObjcDelegateWithContext( \
    	"NSTextViewDelegate", \
    	{"textViewDidChangeSelection:": DidChangeSelectionContext}, \
    	tContext) into tDelegate

    if tDelegate is not nothing then
    	put tDelegate into mTextViewDelegate
    end if

In this case the context variable will be passed as first argument of
the corresponding LCB callback:

    private handler DidChangeSelectionContext(in pContext, in pNotification as ObjcObject) returns nothing
    	post "selectionChanged" with [pContext]
    end handler

Some protocols consist of purely optional methods. In this case the
information about the protocol's methods are not available from the
objective-c runtime API. For this eventuality there are also handlers
`CreateObjcInformalDelegate` and `CreateObjcInformalDelegateWithContext`.

These handlers take a list of foreign handlers as their first argument
instead of a protocol name. The foreign handlers' information is used to
resolve incoming selectors so that the desired LCB callback is called.
For example the `NSSoundDelegate` protocol has only one method, and it
is optional,

    - (void)sound:(NSSound *)sound didFinishPlaying:(BOOL)aBool;

So in order to create an `NSSoundDelegate`, we need to create a list of
foreign handlers, in this case just the following:

    foreign handler NSSoundDidFinishPlaying(in pSound as ObjcId, in pDidFinish as CSChar) binds to "objc:.-sound:didFinishPlaying:"

and create the informal delegate

    handler DidSoundFinish(in pSound as ObjcId, in pDidFinish as Boolean) returns nothing
    	if pDidFinish then
    		post "soundFinished"
    	end if
    end handler

    foreign handler Objc_SetSoundDelegate(in pSound as ObjcId, in pDelegate as ObjcId) returns nothing \
    	binds to "objc:NSSound.-setDelegate:"
    ...

    variable tDelegate as optional ObjcObject
    put CreateObjcInformalDelegate( \
    	[NSSoundDidFinishPlaying], \
    	{"textViewDidChangeSelection:": DidChangeSelection}) \
    	into tDelegate
    end if
    if tDelegate is not nothing then
    	put tDelegate into mSoundDelegate
    	Objc_SetSoundDelegate(tSound, tDelegate)
    end if

> _Note:_ Delegate properties are usually 'assigned' rather than
> 'retained', so it is necessary to store them in module variables
> until they are no longer needed. Generally the pattern required is
> as follows:

    handler OnOpen()
    	-- Create native view and set native layer
    	-- Set native view delegate property
    	-- Store view and delegate in module vars
    end handler

    handler OnClose()
    	-- Set native view delegate property to nothing
    	-- Put nothing into view and delegate module vars
    	-- Set native layer to nothing
    end handler

### Core types

-   The following deprecated core type names have been removed:
    -   `boolean` (replaced by `Boolean`)
    -   `integer` (replaced by `Integer`)
    -   `real` (replaced by `Real`)
    -   `number` (replaced by `Number`)
    -   `string` (replaced by `String`)
    -   `data` (replaced by `Data`)
    -   `array` (replaced by `Array`)
    -   `list` (replaced by `List`)


-   The use of the keyword `undefined`, which was deprecated in LiveCode
    8.0.0, has been removed.  Use `nothing` instead.

    -   Use `returns nothing` when defining a handler which returns no
        value.
    -   Use `nothing` to indicate no value when manipulating optionally
        type variables

-   The `is defined`, `is undefined`, `is not defined`, and `is not
    undefined` syntax, which was deprecated in LiveCode 8.0.0, has been
    removed.  Use `is` and `is not` with `nothing` instead.
    -   Use `<expr> is nothing` and `<expr> is not nothing` to test
        whether an expression has a value or not
    -   The expression `<left> is <right>` will now evaluate to `true` if
        `<left>` and `<right>` are both nothing
    -   The expression `<left> is not <right>` will now evaluate to `true`
        if one of `<left>` or `<right>` are nothing (but not both).

### Identifiers

-   Identifiers are now expected to match `[A-Z0-9_.]`.


-   Unqualified identifiers are now expected to match `[A-Z0-9_]`. The `.`
    symbol is interpreted as a namespace operator.

### Syntax

-   Syntax keywords are no longer permitted to match `[A-Z0-9_.]`.


-   `metadata` definitions may now occur anywhere a module's top-level
    context.


-   `use` declarations may now occur anywhere in a module's top-level
    context.

### Expressions

-   It is now possible to use array constants and array expressions in
    Extension Builder programs.  For example:

        variable tArray as Array
        put {"key": true} into tArray

    Keys in array literals must be strings.

### Objective-C dynamic instance method binding

It is now possible to bind to instance methods dynamically, by leaving
empty the name of the class in the binding string. In particular this
enables calling protocol-defined instance methods on class instances,
which was not previously possible.

For example, to directly call the `NSAlertDelegate` method
`alertShowHelp:` on an `NSAlert` instance:

    -- bind to delegate protocol method
    foreign handler NSAlertDelegateShowHelp(in pTarget as ObjcId, in pAlert as ObjcId) binds to "objc:.-alertShowHelp:"
    ...
    -- call alertShowHelp on an NSAlert, passing the alert itself as the
    -- first parameter.
    NSAlertDelegateShowHelp(tAlert, tAlert)

### Unsafe Attributes

-   The compiler now understands the idea of 'safety' of handlers and blocks of
    code.

-   Handlers can be marked as being 'unsafe', e.g.

        unsafe handler Foo()
            ... do unsafe things ...
        end handler

-   Blocks of statements can be marked as being 'unsafe', e.g.

        unsafe
            ... do unsafe things ...
        end unsafe

-   All foreign handlers are considered to be 'unsafe'.

-   All bytecode blocks are considered to be 'unsafe'.

-   Calls to foreign handlers and unsafe handlers can only be made within unsafe
    handlers or unsafe statement blocks.

-   Usage of bytecode blocks can only be made within unsafe handlers or unsafe
    statement blocks.

### Nullable aggregate fields

-   Aggregate fields of Pointer type can now contain `nothing`,
    i.e. null pointers

### Bytecode Blocks

-   bytecode can now be directly written in handlers using a bytecode block:

        bytecode
           register tTemp
           assign_constant tTemp, 1
        end bytecode

-   for more details on what bytecode operations can be used see the LiveCode
    Builder Bytecode Reference

-   bytecode blocks are not for general use and the current set of bytecode
    operations are subject to change

### Foreign aggregate support (experimental)

-   It is now possible to bind to C functions and Obj-C methods which take
    simple structs by-value, or return a struct by-value. For full details see
    the 'Foreign Aggregate Types' section of the language reference.

### Namespaces

-   Identifiers in LCB can now be qualified, to disambiguate between
    symbols defined in different namespaces.

## Extension Builder Documentation

### Style guide

-   Updated naming guide for handlers and types
-   Added indentation and wrapping guidelines
-   New section with widget-specific recommendations

## Extension Builder Virtual Machine

### Array and list assign ops

Previously there was a difference between constructing a list or array
using `push` or `put` and using list or array assigment expressions `[]`
and `{}`, namely values were converted to `optional any` only in the
latter case. For consistency, they are now converted in both cases.
