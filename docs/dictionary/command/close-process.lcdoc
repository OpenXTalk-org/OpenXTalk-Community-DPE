Name: close process

Type: command

Syntax: close process <processName>

Summary:
Closes a <process> that was started with the <open process> <command>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Security: process

Example:
close process "/bin/sh"

Example:
close process tOpenProgram

Parameters:
processName:
The file path / parameters that were used to run the process with the open process command.

Description:
Use the <close process> <command> to tell a <process> to <exit> after
you've finished using it.

On desktop systems, <close process> tells a
<process|process's> <standard input> to end running. The <process> then finishes
processing whatever data remains, and then exits.

Once opened a <process> may remain in the openProcesses list but its ID number
in the the openProcessIDs list will be 0 (zero) if the process is not actually
running. If a process was opened with the access mode neither, it exits
automatically when it finishes running, and does not need to be closed.

You can use the <kill> <command> instead to quit a process.

The process may take a short time to exit after you issue the
<close process> <command>. Since two <process|processes> cannot have the
same name, you need to wait for a <process> to exit before opening a new
<process> with the same name.

To reopen the same <process> after closing
it, use the <wait> <command> to delay until the <process> has finished
exiting:

    close process myProcess
    wait until myProcess is not among the lines of the openProcesses
    open process myProcess

>*Note:* Child process related syntax may behave differently on various platforms.
