Name: openProcessIDs

Type: function

Syntax: the openProcessIDs

Syntax: openProcessIDs()

Summary:
<return|Returns> the <process> IDs of <process|processes> that have been
opened with the <open process> <command>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Security: process

Example:
the openProcessIDs

Example:
put last line of the openProcessIDs into previousProcessID

Returns:
The <openProcessIDs> <function> <return|returns> a list of
<integer|integers>, one per <line>.

Description:
Use the <openProcessIDs> <function> to communicate with
<process|processes> you have opened with the <open process> <command>.

Certain Unix commands such as "kill" require a PID (process ID) number.
You can use these commands to act on processes by using the shell
<command> :

    put "kill -9" && line 1 of the openProcessIDs into whatToExecute
    get shell(whatToExecute)

The list of process IDs is in the same order used by openProcesses
<function>, which is the same order that the <process|processes> were
opened.

Programs that were not started by OpenXTalk are not included in the list
returned by the <openProcessIDs> <function>.
